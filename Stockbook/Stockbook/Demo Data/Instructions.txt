Demo Data for Stockbook
1. Open "Demo Data.xlsx"
2. Change the settings on Company Name and Currency 
3. Input the "Products" tab, add each product 
4. Add the "Purchased" tab
5. After doing that, the "After Purchased" tab shows what the main window should look like
6. Add the "Sales" and so on... 

Note: I included the database (backup) that is called "demodatabase.stockbook" 
that can be restored in the Settings tab
